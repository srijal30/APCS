# FROGHATS PRESENTS DEQUE:
**ROSTER:** Alif Rahman, Salaj Rijal, Kevin Cheng

**Design Decisions:** We decided to create a wrapper class for LinkedList to create an interface of Deque because 
it already had the functionality that we were looking for, all we had to do was "pass thru" the methods. Additionally,
LinkedList already implements Deque which made things a whole lot easier.

## OUR IMPLEMENTATION:
* public T removeLast()
* public T removeFirst()
* public void addFirst(T)
* public void addLast(T)
* public T peekFirst()
* public T peekBottom()
* public int size()
* public boolean isEmpty()

* public T pollFirst();
* public T pollLast();

##  TO DO LIST:
* We finished everything :)
