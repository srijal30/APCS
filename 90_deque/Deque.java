/*
DISCO:
- Turns out LinkedList already implements Deque, so all we did was "pass-thru" the necessary LinkedList methods.

QCC:
- Are we doing this right?
- What other functionality should we add to our Deque?
- What are some good names for the interface methods? Should they be the same as stated in the API?
