HW90 -- Swabbing the Deque -- Implementing our own Deque class
2022-04-12
time spent: .5 hours

* Our idea was to create Deque as a wrapper class of Linked List.
* The API includes methods we didn't include in our class such as poll, offer, etc. However,
  we didn't include these methods in our queue implementation so we did not include them here.


DISCO:
- Turns out LinkedList already implements Deque, so all we did was "pass-thru" the necessary LinkedList methods.

QCC:
- Are we doing this right?
- What other functionality should we add to our Deque?
- What are some good names for the interface methods? Should they be the same as stated in the API?
