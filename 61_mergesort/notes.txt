2022-2-7
time spent: .2 hours

DISCO:

QCC:
-can the people who received cards already take cards offered by another thinkeren


REFLECTION:

THINKER FIRMWARE:
-take cards offered by another thinker
-if you have more than 1 card, split your deck and give each deck to another thinker
-if you have 1 card, return to your thinker
-if you have 2 decks, merge the 2 decks (keeping them sorted) and then return
the new deck to the person who gave them to you

how to clean-up:
-solidify rules on who to give the cards to (preferably the people next to you, not across the room)
-dont focus on what the group is doing, only focus on your task at hand
