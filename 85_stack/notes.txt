HW 85 -- Leon Leonwood Stack -- Creating a AL and LL implementation of Stack
2022-03-30
time spent: .2 hours

DISCO:
-we dont need any instance variables besides the respective Object (AL or LL)
-we are basically creating a wrapper class (we just use the functionality of LL or AL to help us)

QCC:
-why is there no initcapacity?
-why was there a Z in the main method? Was there a way we could have used that or was taht a 
temp placeholder?
-is LL Stack or AL Stack better? Our guess right now is LL Stack because AL's remove is O(n)
