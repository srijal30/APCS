QCC:
how exactly do the GUI and CelebrityGame interact?

Panel vs Frame what is the difference? Also what are Cards? Basically what is the structure 
of JFrame Objects?

Does the GUI take care of setting up the first gameCelebrity?
-no it doesnt, this is handled in the play method

DISCO:
The documentation is helpful.

The CelebrityFrame class is not complete.
