## Experience
Overall the lab was pretty fun, as we got to get a glimpse into the work processes of a software engineer as they are designing a new product. There were a few things that we found annoying, such as having to build upon the College Boards framework instead of starting from scratch. This was annoying because it took time to understand their code and the way they implemented it, but this is one of the perils of software engineering so it was a good experience.
