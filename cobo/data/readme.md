### DATA LAB

**TNPG:** FLying SulleN AcToRs
**Roster:** Salaj Rijal, ALif Rahman, Faiyaz Rafee

### Journey

Overall we found this lab to be challenging. The main reason for this is because of the externals tool involved. Additionally, sinbad had very little documentation. However, thanks to the QAF, this wasnt as big of an issue that it couldve been. 

However, at the conclusion of the lab we were glad to have suffered through the lab due to the extra tools at our disposable (sinbad.jar, external datasets, javac -classpath)
