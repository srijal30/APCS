Questions for Activity 2:

1. Explain in your own words the relationships between a deck and a card

    A card is an array list that contains ranks, suits and pointValues. A deck contains cards.

2. Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?

    Strings[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
    Strings[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
    int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 12};
    Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);

    It will result in an error since there are not enought elements in suits so it would results in an IndexOutOfBound error.

3. Make a Deck for Twenty-One (completed) 

4. Does the order of elements of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays matter?

    Yes because otherwise it would make impossible cards such as a king card with a pointValue of 3
