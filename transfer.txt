01:
Semicoloms are important
What does public mean, what does static means
you do single line comments with // and multiline with /* */

02: 
Class name is the same as file name
you have to say what type of data a variable will be
Is there a more effiecient way to do this?
If you put final for variable it means its a constant
If you divide int by double you get a double (int and double are not the same)

03:
you can have multiple methods in a file
the main method is the only method that is guarenteed to be used all other methods are used branching from main

04:
if-statements need conditions in parentheses

05:
you can describe what is in a function with /** */
you have to specify what datatype a function returns

06:
there are 3 types of loops
-For
-While
-Enhanced For
you can use printf to help you format a string that you are printing

07:
Arrays are really bad in java, you cannot change amount of values and are stuck with a set number of values
Only one type of data type can be used in a array that you have to call beforehand
