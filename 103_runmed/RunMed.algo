OUR ALGO:

lilvals is the maxHeap
bigvals is the minHeap

ADD:

1. if the newVal is less than the minVal of bigVals, then add it to lilvals
2. else add newVal to bigVals
3. if bigVals is 2 items greater than lilVals, transer minVal from bigVal to lilVal
4. if bigVals is less than lilVals, transfer maxval from lilVals to bigVals

GET MEDIAN:
1. if trees have equals element size, return the average of the extreme vals of bigVals and lilVal
2. else return bigVals's extreme value
