-3 Types of Errors:
 Compile-Time: Due to misused syntax

 Run-TimeL Occur when project is running

 Logic: Not an error with the program, it works at it is meant to, 
 but an error regarding the intedned result not working.

-Compile-Time Errors:
 Usually only the first error is reliable, as the rest of the Errors
 might be a result of it.

Check for these when looking for common errors:
 1. Nesting
 2. Casing
 3. Semicolons
 4. Matching quotes
 5. Type Matching
 6. Right arguements
 7. Static and instance invocations and methods

 If all else fails debug by bisection. Erase half of code and run 
 program. If runs, then you know error is in deleted half.

 Remember compilier doesnt always give right answer.

-Run-Time Errors:
 StackOverFlowError from infinite recursion or loop. Use print statements
 to help understand the conditions to try to pinpoint where the 
 mistake is.

 Exceptions are what runtime errors are called that are displayed in
 terminal.

 Make sure your print statemts are clear to read so you can understand
 the output of your program.

 -Logic Errors:
  To solve these type of errors try to trace your program step by step.
  You need to understand how your code works. 

  Try to make your code as readable as possible and when testing methods, you
  can print their return values before actulaly returning.

  Duckies, breaks, and other human beings for help.

  When you find bug... learn from it.
