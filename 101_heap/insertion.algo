TO ADD A VALUE IN A MIN HEAP:

0. if there there isnt a root in the current tree, add the new node.
1. if the new node's value is smaller than the value of the current node, then swap current node with new node. Then add the value to the less deep subtree.
2. if it is greater, then add the current node to the less deep subtree.
